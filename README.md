# MovieWebsite

For our class project, we were assigned with creating a movie website from scratch using C# and ASP.NET. The structure of the code follows an MVC program and has general functions including purchasing tickets, accessing purchase history, viewing available movies and schedules, and as well as logging in.


Unfortunately, because the website is no longer online we are unable to display it. However, below is the Entity Relationship Diagram that was used to create the website.
